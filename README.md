# Transparent Pumpkin

![Banner](transparent-pumpkin-banner.jpg)

Wearing a carved pumpkin on your head makes endermen not react aggressive as soon as you look them in the eyes. This might
be useful when entering the End, so that a mass of endermen will not attack you. Or maybe you just wear it because it looks
cool which is especially the case for horror maps or Halloween. However wearing a pumpkin comes with one downside: You can
barely see anything in the first person view.

This add-on fixes this issue by making the pumpkin screen transparent. You
are able to set the opacity to 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% or 100% (100% = opaque = vanilla). Most resource packs completely
disable the pumpkin blur on the skin, however it might be a better choice to keep it slightly visible so you cannot forget
that you are wearing one.


## Changing the Opacity

1. Activate the add-on.
2. Click on the add-on.
3. Click on the cogwheel.
4. Use the slide to adjust the opacity.

> **Note**
> 
> By default the opacity is set to 100% which is the same as playing without the add-on enabled. **Change the resolution
> to a lower value**.
